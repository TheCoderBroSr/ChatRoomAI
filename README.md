# ChatRoomAI
A chatroom made in python using ChatGPT only :)


## This runs on your local server. To use it, you have to:  

1. Run the server.py file  

1. Run the client.py file, in terminal/command prompt  

1. It will ask for a username  

1. After pressing enter, it will open a tkinter window  

1. Start chatting :)


## Note: The default port is 12345, make sure to change it in case there is something already running on it.  

## Future Goals: To make this a website or something, so that anyone can access it across the globe :)
